# Archive Folder

This folder contains deprecated/experimental files that are no longer used in the build but kept for reference.

## Contents

- `x/` - Experimental portfolio layouts that use old image paths (`/images/portfolio/`)
  - These files were created during early development
  - They reference images that have been migrated to `/src/assets/images/portfolio/` for optimization
  - Keeping them here preserves the layout experiments without triggering build warnings
