## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger

### Wet Ingredients
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup milk (any kind)

### Mix-ins
- 2 cups grated carrots (about 3-4 medium carrots)
- ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
- ½ cup raisins (optional)

## Instructions

### Prep Work
1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C)
2. **Line muffin tin** with paper liners or grease well
3. **Grate carrots** using a box grater or food processor
4. **Set aside** chopped nuts and raisins if using

### Making the Batter
1. **Combine dry ingredients** in a large bowl:
   - Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices
   - Set aside

2. **Mix wet ingredients** in another bowl:
   - Whisk sugar and oil until well combined
   - Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each
   - Stir in vanilla extract and milk

3. **Combine wet and dry**:
   - Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients
   - Fold gently with a spatula until *just combined*
   - Don't overmix! A few lumps are okay

4. **Fold in mix-ins**:
   - Gently fold in grated carrots
   - Add nuts and raisins if using

### Baking
1. **Fill muffin cups** about ¾ full
2. **Bake for 18-22 minutes** until:
   - Tops are golden brown
   - Toothpick inserted in center comes out clean
   - Muffin springs back when lightly pressed
3. **Cool** in pan for 5 minutes
4. **Transfer** to wire rack to cool completely

## Tips for Success

### Don't Overmix!
The secret to tender muffins is minimal mixing. Stir until ingredients are *just* combined - you should still see a few streaks of flour. Overmixing develops gluten and makes tough, dense muffins.

### Carrot Prep
- **Squeeze excess moisture**: After grating, gently squeeze carrots in a clean kitchen towel to remove excess liquid
- **Grate size matters**: Medium grate works best - too fine and they'll disappear, too coarse and you'll have chunks

### Storage
- **Room temp**: Store in airtight container for 3-4 days
- **Freeze**: Wrap individually in plastic, then store in freezer bag for up to 3 months
- **Reheat**: Microwave for 15-20 seconds or warm in 300°F oven for 5-10 minutes

## Variations

### Cream Cheese Frosting
Beat together:
- 4 oz cream cheese (softened)
- 2 tablespoons butter (softened)
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

Spread on cooled muffins for an extra treat!

### Make Them Healthier
- Replace half the flour with whole wheat
- Use honey or maple syrup instead of sugar (reduce to ½ cup)
- Substitute applesauce for half the oil
- Add ¼ cup ground flaxseed

### Other Mix-ins
- Shredded coconut
- Dried cranberries instead of raisins
- White or dark chocolate chips
- Crushed pineapple (drain well!)
