An administrative tool designed to visually display incoming and outgoing data packets through a network. The administrator is able to filter by location/IP, pause the stream, and limit the number of packets displayed at one time.

The application provides real-time visualization of network traffic, making it easier for administrators to monitor and secure their networks.
