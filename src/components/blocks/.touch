# Atomic Design - Component Architecture

## Atoms (your "small components")

Button, Input, Label, Icon
Single-purpose, highly reusable
No business logic


## Molecules (your "bigger components")

Form, SearchBar, Card
Combine atoms into functional units
Some local state/logic


## Organisms (your "sections")

ContactSection, HeroSection, TestimonialBlock
Complete, self-contained sections
Business logic and data fetching

---

I used Atoms, Blocks and Sections because "Blocks" and "Sections" are self-evident, but "UI" is generic. Also "atoms" come before blocks alphabetically.
