  # Check if MongoDB service is running
  Get-Service MongoDB

  If it says "Running", you're good. If not, start it:

  # Start MongoDB service (may need admin PowerShell)
  Start-Service MongoDB

  OR if MongoDB isn't set up as a service, you can start it manually in another terminal:

  # In a separate PowerShell window
  & "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "C:\data\db"

  Then in your venv terminal, run the app:

  # Make sure you're in activated venv (you should see (venv))
  python app.py

  Note: Inside the venv, just use python, not python2. The venv's python IS Python 2.7.

  Once MongoDB is running and you start the app, you should be able to:
  1. Visit the app in your browser
  2. Login with the credentials from the restored database

  Let me know if MongoDB service is running or if you need to start it manually!
