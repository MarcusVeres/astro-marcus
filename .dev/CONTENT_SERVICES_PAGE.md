## Notes

**Page Purpose:** Showcase service offerings (currently appears to be a design/layout testing ground)

**Current State:** Page seems to be under development with placeholder content and button experiments

**Recommended Approach:** This page needs content strategy before we can properly document it. Currently it's demonstrating various UI patterns rather than presenting actual services.

**Next Steps:** Define actual service offerings, pricing, and value propositions before finalizing content.
